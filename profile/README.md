The challenge focuses on enhancing security for a Digital Wallet Application (DWA) by leveraging Passwordless Blockchain Secure Authentication (BSA). It addresses the vulnerabilities of traditional passwords, which are prone to attacks like phishing and credential stuffing. Bank A aims to introduce a Digital Wallet that prioritizes secure, seamless authentication across web and mobile platforms, enhancing customer experience through a passwordless approach.

**Objectives:**
- Develop or submit a fully functional DWA for web and mobile platforms using Passwordless BSA as the sole authentication method. The mobile app will also act as an authenticator for BSA.

**Key Requirements:**
- **Basic Functionalities:** Include user account management, UI/UX design, transaction history, wallet-to-wallet transfers, and wallet reloads.
- **Authentication:** Implement Passwordless BSA for login, access control (e.g., user profiles, account balances), and payment transactions (e.g., wallet reloads, transfers).

**Tasks:**
1. Develop or use an existing DWA that meets the outlined requirements.
2. Integrate Passwordless Login Authentication for user access.
3. Integrate Passwordless Authentication for Access Control, ensuring that certain functions are only accessible after successful authentication.
4. Integrate Passwordless Authentication for Payment Transactions, requiring authentication before processing wallet operations.

**Implementation Notes:**
- The application must be developed for Android, with the mobile app serving as the authenticator.
- Participants can develop their own DWA or use an existing one but must meet the required functionalities.
- The BSA integration should complete within 10-20 seconds for each authentication phase.

This challenge encourages creativity, allowing participants to add extra features as long as the minimum requirements are met.
